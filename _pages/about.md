## <i class="fa fa-bullseye" aria-hidden="true"></i> My focus

**Appropriate technology**: tech is a big part of my work; through the years I honed an understanding of what appropriate technology means for organisations with radically different sizes, goals and resources. There is no boilerplate approach that will work each time, because there are no boilerplate problems.

I help with understanding which approach works best for _that_ project, in _that_ context, with _that_ group of humans.  

**Human systems:** Each group of humans is larger than the sum of themselves. Together they form a unique system with its own rules, abilities, and dynamics. People’s strengths need the right environment to shine; organising and inspiring teams for human-system magic can provide unexpected solutions and serendipity.

I help identify what makes that human system unique, to design projects with that same uniqueness at its core.


## <i class="fa fa-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></i> My Toolbox

**Human-centered design principles:** stakeholders, audiences, users — whatever you call them, they are the humans you are trying to reach. The Human-centered design approach makes sure they are involved from the outset. Assumption/validation loops, iterative creation, prototyping, and development timelines.

**Peer events:** the best way to achieve a shared vision is to build the vision together. I facilitate peer workshops, blurring the line between participants and experts. Experiential learning, adult learning, resource/content co-creation.

**Project inception sprints:** taking a fuzzy yet great idea into a concrete, actionable action plan. Vision for success, audience mapping, team composition, resource analysis.

**Project clinics:** tailored troubleshooting for existing projects, starting at situational analysis and going all the way up to organisational change.

**Targeted advice:** sometimes a small nudge at the right time can have long-lasting influence. Tactical course corrections, integrating new crucial information, identifying pivot opportunities.

**Quick interventions:** pro-bono emergency repairs for wobbly projects. My digital door is always open. Don't worry if you're just at the ideation stage, find yourself in a crunch at the final stages, or anywhere in between — I am here to help.

## <i class="fa fa-coffee" aria-hidden="true"></i> What drives me

The relationship between humans and technology. More specifically, the cognitive abyss between the tools we use every day and our understanding of them. Tools define humanity, and essentially represent an extension of ourselves. However, we’re not as capable of deeply understanding modern tools, as we were in the past. A machine cog is a concept that is easy to grasp: recursion isn’t. Yet everyday on average we use more tools driven by recursive loops, than those driven by cogs (unless you’re Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times). [This imbalance can cause inequality, take away control, fuel extremism, exacerbate solitude](https://tin.fyi/take-back-control/). I wish to interrogate how humans and machines interact, and find ways to give humans tools for grasping, understanding, subverting and ultimately owning the obscure principles that guide machines to make  decisions that affect society.
